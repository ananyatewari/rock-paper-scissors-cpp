# Game Description

Rock paper scissors is a classic and traditional hand game that almost all of us have been playing since childhood. The player can make any one of the three specified actions- a rock (by making a fist), a paper (by stretching out all five fingers) or a scissor (by making a victory sign with two fingers). There are generally 2 players in this game and the winner is declared depending on a small set of rules. A paper completely covers the entire rock, a rock smashes the scissors and the scissors cut through the paper. Accordingly, the score is calculated.
